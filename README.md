- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JamieRRichards
- 
- This GitHub is being used to play around with some coding and get myself back on track with learning Full Stack WebDev stuff!
- It is also very useful as it hosts my website!
- 
- Familiar coding stuff: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQL.
- Looking to learn more PHP & JavaScript.
